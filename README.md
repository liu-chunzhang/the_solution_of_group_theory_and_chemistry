# the_solution_of_group_theory_and_chemistry

This repository is used to save the solution of exercises that I summarized when I read group theory and chemistry.
此仓库用于保存个人在阅读教材group theory and chemistry时整理的章末习题答案。

The chemical formula images are drawn using the domestic software KingDraw, and I use the student version.
化学式图像绘制采用的是国产软件KingDraw，个人使用学生版。

The images of functions, simple geometric bodies and their combinations are drawn using the domestic software AxGlyph, which I have paid for.
函数及简单几何体及其组合的图像绘制采用的是国产软件AxGlyph，个人已付费买断。

In the process of solving them, I found and referenced the information on some websites, which are recorded in the text and are not listed here one by one.
在解决习题过程中，我找到并参考了部分网站的信息，一并记录在文中，不单独在此一一罗列。

In my opinion, this book clearly introduces the application of finite group representation theory in chemistry and can be used as an excellent textbook. However, I felt that it is not easy to solve the after-class questions completely, when I solved them independently. So I specially compiled a copy for future reference by myself and others.
在我看来，本书在有限群表示论在化学中的应用介绍清楚，完全可以作为一本优秀的教材。但其课后题完整解决难度并不小，我在自己独立解决它们时深感如此。所以我特地整理一份，以备日后自己和其他人查阅参考。
